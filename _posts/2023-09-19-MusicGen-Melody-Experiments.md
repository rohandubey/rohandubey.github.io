title: "MusicGen-Melody Fine-Tuning: Create Your Own Melodies"
---

> MusicGen Melody is the coolest music-generating AI I've ever seen! It can generate melodies in any style you want, from classical to pop to rock. And it's so easy to use! Just feed it a few examples of the kind of melody you want, and it will generate a new one for you. It's like having your own personal composer! I'm so excited about MusicGen Melody because it opens up so many new possibilities for musicians and composers. We can now create unique and original melodies, and we can do it in a fraction of the time it would take to write them ourselves.

## Unleash Your Melodic Magic
<definition>
Embark on a journey to craft your symphonic tales. The first step? Curate a melody treasure trove! Ensure it's tuned to dance harmoniously with the MusicGen framework. The script `text2json.py` is your melody maestro, orchestrating the transformation from `txt+wav` to `json+wav`.

But that's not all! Craft a symphony manifesto - a poetic parchment listing the sacred paths of your audio and text creations. The <span style="color:blue">**AudioDataset symphony**</span> weaves it all together.

Tune in to the <span style="color:blue">**config folder**</span> - it's the control room for your melodic odyssey.
