**Abstract:**

*This paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MA-DRL) method for load frequency control of a renewable energy single-area power system in a continuous action-space domain. This method can non-linearly adapt the control strategies for cooperative LFC control through off-policy learning. Multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) is proposed to adjust and refine the control system parameters considering variational load and source behaviour. Implementation of the model requires only local information for each control area to achieve an optimal control state. Comparison between TD3 and DDPG model proves the edge of TD3 model. Simulations and numerical data comparison on a renewable energy single-area power system demonstrate that the proposed model can successfully reduce control errors and stochastic frequency deviations caused by load and renewable power fluctuations.*

### [Coordinated load frequency control of a smart hybrid power system using the DEMA-TD3 algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967066123000497)

**Abstract:**

*In this paper, a novel deep reinforcement (DRL) algorithm is proposed for the coordination of controllers in a multi-source hybrid power system (HPS) for load frequency control (LFC). Decentralized controllers regulate the distributed sources with uncertainties in load and source power deviations to maintain the power system frequency. Coordination of decentralized controllers becomes challenging in the presence of dynamic disturbances. A novel LFC framework is introduced via a dynamic environment-based multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (DEMA-TD3) algorithm to coordinate the decentralized controllers. Moreover, system stability is a concern in systems with renewable integration during islanding operations. To achieve successful islanding, a smart home inverter (SHI) based coordinated control is proposed. Virtual inertia (VI) is added to provide additional frequency support for robust control. Various simulation test scenarios are simulated to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed novel LFC architecture in different modes of operation.*
