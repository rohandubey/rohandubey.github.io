## [Amazon, Bangalore](https://www.amazon.in/)   
<h3 align="left"> Applied Scientist Intern <span style="float:right;">June, 22 - Nov, 22</span></h3> 
**Project :**  Bias mitigation for equitable learning. 
1. Developed methodologies to mitigate bias in the Alexa NLU model's performance across different customer groups using continual learning algorithms. These techniques are tested on open-source data for their general applicability in tackling the model bias.
2. Worked with Alexa NLU data to create, analyse and deploy deep learning models.
3. Developed cross-locale bias mitigation data using data from different locales to mitigate bias in one particular locale using data augmentation techniques.
